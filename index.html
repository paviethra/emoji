      <h1>🤣 Rolling on the Floor Laughing</h1>
      <p>
        A yellow face with a big grin and scrunched, X-shaped eyes, tilted on
        its side as if rolling on the floor laughing (the internet acronym
        ROFL). Sheds two tears and tilts right on most platforms. Often
        conveys hysterical laughter more intense than 😂 Face With Tears of
        Joy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>🥰 Smiling Face with Hearts</h1>
      <p>
        A yellow face with smiling eyes, a closed smile, rosy cheeks, and
        several hearts floating around its head. Expresses a range of happy,
        affectionate feelings, especially being in love. The number of hearts
        (three or more) varies by platform
      </p>

      <h1>🤪 Zany Face</h1>
      <p>
        A smiley making a silly face. A yellow face with a big grin and wide,
        white eyes, one larger than the other and in a wild, cockeyed
        expression. Many platforms, including Apple, depict its tongue stuck
        out and head tilted; others feature a full-toothed grin, giving it a
        more unhinged appearance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>😹 Cat with Tears of Joy</h1>
      <p>
        A cartoon cat variant of 😂 Face With Tears of Joy. Depicted as yellow
        on major platforms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>❤️ Red Heart</h1>
      <p>
        A classic love heart emoji, used for expressions of love. Displayed in
        various shades of red on most platforms. A similar emoji exists for
        the heart suit in a deck of playing cards.
